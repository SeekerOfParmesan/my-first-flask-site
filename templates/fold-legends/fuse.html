  <div style="width:750px;">This legend came out in season 8 and is called Fuse.<br>
  fuse lost his arm to a charcter named mad maggie and no has a bionic arm. fuse is quite underpowered but his one strength is launching more bombs than the US army onto your enemies. it will not always work but it is funâ˜º.
