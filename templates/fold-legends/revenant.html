  <div style="width:750px;">This legend came out in season 4 and is called Revenant.<br>
  Revenant is the edgelord main because his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75szF5i41Bw">Trailer</a> in which you can see the surface his charcter perfectly and his capability in a fight (acording to the lore).<br>
  Revenant is underpowered in the game if you take into consideration that HE HAS THE LARGEST HITBOX IN THE GAME BECAUSE HE IS 203 CM TALL OR 6'8". And his ultimate requires the most teamwork of the entire game.<br><br>Lore dump:<br><br>
  "Revenant" is the code name of the first simalacrum created by Hammond Robotics(henceforth Hammond). created with the frozen remains of the 44-year-old hitman Kaleb Cross. Hammond, Rightfully fearing that Kaleb will not be happy about being a Simalacrum installed a filter to make him not see that he is a Simalacrum into his neck. During the creation of Revenant Hammond is aproched by the Syndacate, they need a killing machine. Hammand creates Revenant to be the perfect killing machine. No fellings of mercy, remorse, pity or compassion. Revenant gets used every time the Syndacate needs someone dead, so Revenant keeps killing for over 200 Years until the moment seen in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75szF5i41Bw">Trailer</a> because the glass shard in his neck hit the filter perfectly he now knows he is a simalacrum.After this in the penthouse he finds a reflectve surface and looks aat himself and remembers. every death. every kill. every day. And he feels the death of Kaleb Cross. Revenant goes seeking revange against his makers so he tracks down a Hammond employee and <s>interrogates</s> tortures them until he gives the reason he was created. after this he mails the lifeless body, which he cut into pieces, to the hammond employees family. After this he went on a mass homicide against all Hammond employees, ending after hes killed around 99% of everything conected to Hammond. Now his history goes blank for 25 years, until a new legend sponsored by Hammond does an interview about his admission into the APEX games. seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmmNYDmvS2k">here</a>. After this Revenant gets invited to the APEX games as a containment plan because the topdogs in the Syndacate and Hammond fear him, and they think that if they put him in a bloodsport, it will distract him....
